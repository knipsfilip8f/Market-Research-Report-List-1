<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blow-off Valves (BOV) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two Pressure Signals</li><li>One Pressure Signals</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Blow-off valves (BOV) are essential components in turbocharged engines, designed to release excess pressure when the throttle closes, preventing compressor surge. The market is segmented into two types based on pressure signals: those utilizing two pressure signals, where one sensor monitors the manifold pressure and another tracks the intake pressure, allowing for precise control. Conversely, single pressure signal BOVs rely on one sensor for operation, offering a simpler, more cost-effective solution. Both types enhance engine performance and durability.</p></p>
