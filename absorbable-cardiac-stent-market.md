<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absorbable Cardiac Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer</li><li>Bomaterials</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The absorbable cardiac stent market includes primarily two types: polymer-based and biomaterials-based stents. Polymer stents use biodegradable polymers that gradually dissolve in the body, promoting healing while providing temporary support to the artery. Biomaterials stents incorporate natural or synthetic materials designed to facilitate tissue regeneration and minimize inflammation. Both categories aim to enhance patient outcomes by reducing long-term complications associated with permanent stents, thus offering a promising approach in cardiovascular interventions.</p></p>
